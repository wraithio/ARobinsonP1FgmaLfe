Assignment : Figma Your Life

This assignment asks us to create a Figma prototype of a site that shows aspects of our life. We are then to use HTML with CSS to replicate the Figma project.

(Chris Wells-Hott) Comment: Very good job, the only thing I would change is adding a target blank to your link on the contact page so when the user clicks on the links it doesnt leave your website.
